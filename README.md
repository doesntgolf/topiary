topiary v0.2.0-alpha
====================
A meta-search engine in a browser extension. Technically, topiary is an API client, where users describe 
which APIs to query, including how to build a request and how to parse the response. Topiary aggregates 
these parsed results from each of the APIs deemed relevant to the current query.

NOTE: Topiary is is in an alpha-state -- its internal interface is currently unstable; your data and 
preferences may not work from one version to another!


Goals
-----
1. Empower independent, small-scale, and niche data and content providers.

2. Obviate (some) uses of centralized search services.
